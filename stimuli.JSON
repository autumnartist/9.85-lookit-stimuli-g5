This study is based on a published paper https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31301068/.<br><br>The main finding of the study was that 4-5 year old children can use their intuitive understanding of costs and rewards to resolve ambiguous language. The experiment showed that children are able to infer the intended meaning behind vague requests by considering utility maximization, meaning who would find it easier to help or what object would be less costly for one to obtain. Here, the students replicated this experiment. Thank you again for participating! We'll be emailing you a $5 Amazon gift card - this should arrive in your inbox within the next week after we confirm that a child is with you in the video recording and check that your child is in the age range for this study. If you don't hear from us by then, feel free to reach out! Please don’t hesitate to contact me at shengyiw@mit.edu if you have any additional questions or feedback!",
